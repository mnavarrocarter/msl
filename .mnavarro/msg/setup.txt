PROJECT SETUP COMPLETE!

We recommend adding this alias to your shell:

    alias dc="docker-compose"

After you have done it, you can quickly use "dc" to exec into a container:

    dc exec main php -v

To open an alpine shell into the main service, run:

    dc exec main ash

Don't forget to run "make pr" before pushing code for a Pull Request.

Happy coding!
